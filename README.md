## MOTIVATION
To challenge the constranits of a text based game, because text based game can run the risk of being boring or monogamous I would like to attempt to create one that is both engaging and suspensful hence the mystery/thriller aspect aspect.

## ABOUT 
The game begins with the nameless protagonist's little sister having gone missing. The protagonist then receives a text message from the sister's number.  Each message is followed by two actions that the player gets to choose. The game has two alternative endings: choosing the right actions will lead to the happy ending, in which the protagonist manages to locate and rescue the sister, while choosing the wrong actions would result in provoking the kidnapper into killing the sister.

## User Stories and Wireframes
 -Create an enter screen
 -User has two options, choosing the right option will lead them to finding the sister
 -Choosing the wrong answer will provoke the kidnapper to murder the sister
 -If user chooses the wrong answer three times, the sister will be killed. Screen flashes blood red and says "It's your fault, you did this to her."
 -If user makes the right choices, they find the sister's location. User has the option to call 911 and wins.
